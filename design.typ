== s√úper Gantt

Input:
- A general configuration, containing:
    - The regular working days
    - The regular "output" of a generic resource
    - public holidays
- A number of tasks, each with:
  - a given duration (in hours!)
  - Optional: A number of predecessors
  - Optional: A "start earliest" date
  - Optional: The number of generic resources planned
- A number of resources, each with a given "output" of "duration units" per calendar duration
- A number of resource assignments, whith:
    - A resource that is being assigned
    - A percentage, telling us how much of the resource's output is to be spent on the assignment
        - Does this make sense?
- A calendar, that tells us when a given resource has a different availablity (i.e. when the output is different)



Output:
- A Gantt Chart, showing how the tasks interact and how long they take in calendar time, assuming they are processed using generic resources
- A Gantt Chart, showing how the tasks interact and how long they take in calendar time, assuming they are processed *only* by the resources assigned to them. Further, the actual assigned workforce is to be displayed (i.e. if they were generic resources.)
- A chart showing the load of each resource over the course of time.
